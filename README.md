# Hack-A-Thing-2: Weather

### Build Description
This is a weather app that is built with React-Native. It takes weather information from a mock api and displays it on screen.

### [Tutorial Used](https://medium.com/@MentorMate/best-practices-for-building-an-app-with-react-native-components-7dee3b2b010f)

### Things Completed During the Hack-A-Thing
* Finished the base app (Completed by __Weijia__)
* Changed the mock API from employees to weather (Completed by __Edward__)
* Change the component's views and structure to take in weather info (Completed by __Edward__)
* Added an additional tab displaying the current weather (Completed by __Weijia__)

### Things Learned
* React-Native used to be exclusively IOS before becoming cross-platform. Thus, there aren't as many Android-specific tutorials for React-Native compared to IOS-specific ones.
* Using the terminal instead of Android Studio to run the Android app, an additional command had to be ran in order to rebundle everything. [[link]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44446523/unable-to-load-script-from-assets-index-android-bundle-on-windows)

### What didn't work
* We couldn't get the Android version to work because the tutorial was using ios-exclusive components. There weren't readily available equivalent components to use.
